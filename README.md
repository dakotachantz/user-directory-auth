# Self-Managed Robots

Update your directory of robots to allow for authentication and update.
---

Twice you have worked on a directory of robots looking for jobs, once from an array of objects, and then from data stored in MongoDB. 

* For this project, you will take that second version and add             authentication and editing. 

* Your project should allow for each robot -- or human user -- to log into the directory and edit their entry. 

* In addition, new users should be able to sign up for the directory and add their own entry.
