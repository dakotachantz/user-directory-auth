# Return to Robots

Using the MongoDB Node library, create the LinkedIn for Robots project.

In week 1 of Back-End Fundamentals, you built a directory site with job and skill information for robots.

Today, you should download the same data you used in that project.

* Load this data into MongoDB and rebuild the directory site. You will have to query the database via     the MongoDB library `(mongodb)` to get this data.

* This time, add links at the top of the page to go to a page of robots that are currently looking for    work and a page of robots that are currently employed.
